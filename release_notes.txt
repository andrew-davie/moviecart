Main improvements:

 - Replaced bulky expensive obsolete through-hole IC's with modern SMD components
   which can be fully created by PCB assembly houses.

 - Drop in compatible with Combat cartridges. No cutting / drilling / gluing  required.

 - Micro SD Card uses standard FAT file format, so standard copy / drag-n-drop of files works.
   No longer requires separate utility to prepare card and playback no longer experiences
   random noise

 - Supports both NTSC and PAL formats.

 - Enhanced video quality utilizing TIA background and playfield colors and
   optimized color space searches.

 - Reliable startup, as boot time is now 1.14 msec
   (Flashback 2 boot time is 1.52 msec, while Atari 2600 boot time is about 25 msec).
